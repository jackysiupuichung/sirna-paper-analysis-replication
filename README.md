Summer project: single rna sequence workflow
referenced paper: Generation and function of progenitor T cells from StemRegenin-1–expanded CD34+ human hematopoietic progenitor cells
PMID: 31648315
GSEID: GSE135927

Dataset description:gene expression profile of single cell peripheral CD3+ cells from immunodeficient mice injected with human progenitor T-cells (proT-cells). ProT-cell subsets were generated in vitro using human umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ cells that were either non-expanded (naive), or expanded in vitro with the hydrocarbon receptor antagonist, StemRegenin-1 (SR1)

 . 
Purpose of this project: Learn how to collect public available data from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Introduction to single cell rna-seq bioinformatics analysis and package “seurat”.
Experimental design: 

- Quality control on scRNAseq data
- Normalize scRNAseq data
- Feature selection to identify highly variable features
    - Help highlight biological signals in single cell dataset
- Normalize data for pca analysis
- PCA
    - Determine optimal dimensionality of dataset
- tSNE non-linear dimensional reduction
    - to place similar cells together in low-dimensional space.
- Find cluster biomarkers that define each cluster
    - Assigning cell type identity to clusters
